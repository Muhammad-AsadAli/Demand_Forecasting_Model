# Demand Forecasting Model
This project implements a machine learning-based Demand Forecasting Model to predict future product demand using historical sales data. The model can help businesses optimize inventory management, improve supply chain efficiency, and make informed production decisions.

# Problem Statement
Accurately predicting future demand is a critical challenge in supply chain and inventory management. Traditional forecasting methods often fail to capture patterns in real-world data. This project uses a machine learning approach to build a more robust and accurate forecasting model.
